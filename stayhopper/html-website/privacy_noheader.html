                    <p>Stayhopper is a new booking platform that offers customers to book hotel rooms by the hour
                        and gives the flexibility to choose the time of check-in. Customers can choose from 3, 6,
                        12 or 24 hours to book their stay, thereby providing more flexibility and generate more
                        revenue for hotels. We also support hotels to compete against new business models that rent
                        out private properties.</p>
